# Clojure terminology explained 


# Symbol 

What do you think of when we say the word symbol?
- an egyption hyrogliph
- a road sign telling your that children are crossing
- a complany logo 

All these are actually symbols.  The have more meaning than just themselves.  They are a way of simply expressing a value, thought or idea.

In clojure a symbol is a way of refering to something else.  We often use a symbol when we want to refer to something in more than one place.

For example, if we have a value, we can use a symbol to essentally give that value a name.

In a simple example its 
(def miles-walked-today 12)

(def my-birthday "1st January 1990")
